## AI-assisted development

This project started from an AI-generated MVP created with Lovable.dev.
The MVP focused on visuals, basic gameplay, and sound effects.

Subsequent development is intentionally split by responsibility:

- Lovable.dev  
  Used only for UI styling, animations, and sound refinement  
  (branch: `style`)

- Roo Code  
  Used for architectural reasoning, game logic design, and documentation  
  (branch: `logic`)

- GitHub Copilot  
  Used for code-level implementation, refactoring, and tests  
  (branch: `logic`)

This separation is intentional to keep the project small, readable,
and aligned with real-world development practices.
