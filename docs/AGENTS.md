# AGENTS.md

This repository simulates a small multi-role team.

Before making any change, you MUST:
1. Read all documents in `/docs/`
2. Respect branch and role responsibilities
3. Avoid changes outside your assigned scope

The project intentionally starts from an AI-generated MVP.
A refactoring phase is expected and documented.

If documentation and existing code conflict, documentation takes precedence.
